## What is this?

Promania is a social platform built on today's most cutting edge web technologies and best practices to deliver high performance web software and smooth user experience across all devices. 

* Promania is a boilerplate project that uses react, redux and firebase. It has all "Most Wanted" features you need for a full functional Progressive Web Application. The best part is that it is based on to main parts:

* CRA - Create React App which is a very minimalistic boilerplate for react projects but with all webpack, babel and other tools and libraries setup for you. It is maintained by a great team from Facebook
rmw-shell - The part that goes further than CRA. This one has all the main parts that a new application needs. The best about it is that it gets updated even when you have started your new project and added new parts to it. That way we can ensure that all projects get the needed updates.

## Top Features

* Material UI
* Code splitting
* Redux implementation
* Firebase to redux sync
* Authentication
* Authorization
* Push notifications UI integration
* Theming
* Internationalization
* Build in CI (Continues Integration)
* Build in CD (Continues Deployment)

## Progressive Web application (PWA)

A Progressive Web App is:

Progressive - Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it's built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
Responsive - Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.
App-like - Feels like an app, because the app shell model separates the application functionality from application content.
Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn't been tampered with.
Discoverable - Is identifiable as an "application" thanks to W3C manifest and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.
Re-engageable - Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
Installable - Allows users to add apps they find most useful to their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
Linkable - Easily share the application via URL, does not require complex installation.
