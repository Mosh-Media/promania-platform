Promania is a social platform built on today's most cutting edge web technologies and best practices to deliver high performance web software and smooth user experience across all devices. 

* Promania is a boilerplate project that uses react, redux and firebase. It has all "Most Wanted" features you need for a full functional Progressive Web Application. The best part is that it is based on to main parts:
